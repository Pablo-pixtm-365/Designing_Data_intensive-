## Chapter 1 

1.- According to the book, what are the main problems of the applications for their operation?  
> the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing. 

2.- In general terms, what is maintainability? 
> Different professionals on a project must be able to maintain current behavior and adapt the system to new use cases. 

3.- Difference between fault and failure of a software? 
> A fault refers to a component of the software, but this continues to give the user operation, while failure is when the software no longer achieves the desired objective for the user. 

4.- Is it possible that there are multiple hardware failures? Yes, or not and why? 
> No, Because of the time periods that the components fail, not all have the same period. 

5.- Difference between latency and response time? 
> The response time is what the client sees, however Latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled, during which it is latent, waiting for the service. 

6.- What is one of the best tools we have to eliminate accidental complexity? 
The abstraction is to hide a lot of implementation details behind a clean and easy to understand faÃ§ade. 

7.- Is the ease with which we can modify a data system and adapt it to changing requirements closely related to? 
> its simplicity and its abstractions.

8.- What similarities (points) or differences do you see in this book with the previous one? 
> diferents answers
